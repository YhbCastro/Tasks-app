            In this UX case study, I aimed to design an app that simplifies household chores. I delved into existing
            apps to craft a distinctive and adaptable solution for diverse households. This project provided an
            opportunity for creative exploration, as I tackled a substantial and time-intensive aspect of the UX design
            process.
